# Timely-Treats-Food-Delivery-App-UX-Design

In the food delivery app project, user research initiatives were a key focus. This included beta testing, competitive analysis, search log analysis, and qualitative usability testing. These activities provided valuable insights that informed significant improvements in the app's functionality, design, and overall user experience.

Six user personas were created to guide the design process, and more than 100 wireframes were developed using Moqups and Figma, all while following the principles of Google Material Design. This approach ensured a cohesive and user-friendly interface.

Consistency was a priority throughout the design process. Screen layouts were carefully designed to incorporate a consistent logo and adhere to a style guide, maintaining a unified visual identity.

The app's information architecture was thoughtfully structured, incorporating card sorting exercises with a group of users to optimize navigation. Feature prioritization was determined using the MoSCoW method, ensuring that critical features received immediate attention.

Validation efforts extended to error handling procedures and the implementation of an effective onboarding process. These measures were crucial in enhancing usability and ensuring a seamless user experience.

Collectively, these efforts transformed the food delivery app into a user-centered platform that exceeded user expectations.
